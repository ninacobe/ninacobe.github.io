      State of the art large language models rely on randomization to respond to a prompt. As an
      immediate consequence, a model may respond differently to the same prompt if asked multiple times.
      In this work, we argue that the evaluation and ranking of large language models should control for the
      randomization underpinning their functioning. Our starting point is the development of a causal model
      for coupled autoregressive generation, which allows different large language models to sample responses
      with the same source of randomness. Building upon our causal model, we first show that, on evaluations
      based on benchmark datasets, coupled autoregressive generation leads to the same conclusions as vanilla
      autoregressive generation but using provably fewer samples. However, we further show that, on evaluations
      based on (human) pairwise comparisons, coupled and vanilla autoregressive generation can surprisingly
      lead to different rankings when comparing more than two models, even with an infinite amount of samples.
      This suggests that the apparent advantage of a model over others in existing evaluation protocols may not
      be genuine but rather confounded by the randomness inherent to the generation process. To illustrate and
      complement our theoretical results, we conduct experiments with several large language models from the
      Llama family. We find that, across multiple knowledge areas from the popular MMLU benchmark dataset,
      coupled autoregressive generation requires up to 40% fewer samples to reach the same conclusions as
      vanilla autoregressive generation. Further, using data from the LMSYS Chatbot Arena platform, we find
      that the win-rates derived from pairwise comparisons by a strong large language model to prompts differ
      under coupled and vanilla autoregressive generation.

  - title: "Human-Alignment Influences the Utility of AI-assisted Decision Making"
    authors: "<b>Nina Corvelo Benz</b> and Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez"

      Whenever an AI model is used to predict a relevant (binary) outcome in AI-assisted decision making,
      it is widely agreed that, together with each prediction, the model should provide an AI confidence value.
      However, it has been unclear why decision makers have often difficulties to develop a good sense on when
      to trust a prediction using AI confidence values. Very recently, Corvelo Benz and Gomez Rodriguez have
      argued that, for rational decision makers, the utility of AI-assisted decision making is inherently bounded
      by the degree of alignment between the AI confidence values and the decision maker’s confidence on
      their own predictions. In this work, we empirically investigate to what extent the degree of alignment
      actually influences the utility of AI-assisted decision making. To this end, we design and run a large-scale
      human subject study (n = 703) where participants solve a simple decision making task—an online
      card game—assisted by an AI model with a steerable degree of alignment. Our results show a positive
      association between the degree of alignment and the utility of AI-assisted decision making. In addition,
      our results also show that post-processing the AI confidence values to achieve multicalibration with respect
      to the participants’ confidence on their own predictions increases both the degree of alignment and the
      utility of AI-assisted decision making.

      Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global health challenge, complicating the treatment of
      bacterial infections and leading to higher patient morbidity and mortality. Rapid and reliable identifi-
      cation of resistant pathogens is crucial to guide early and effective therapeutic interventions. However,
      traditional culture-based methods are time-consuming, highlighting the need for faster predictive ap-
      proaches. Machine learning models trained on MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry data, readily collected
      in most clinics for fast species identification, offer promise but face limitations in clinical applicabil-
      ity, particularly due to their lack of comprehensive, statistically valid uncertainty estimates. Here, we
      introduce a novel AMR prediction framework that addresses this gap with a novel knowledge graph-
      enhanced conformal predictor. Conformal prediction (CP) constructs prediction sets with statistical
      coverage guarantees, ensuring that bacterial resistance to a certain antibiotic is flagged with a specified
      error rate. Our proposed conformal predictor constructs improved prediction sets over standard CP ap-
      proaches by using a knowledge graph capturing the interdependencies in antibiotic resistance patterns.
      In addition, we introduce a novel classifier framework that improves upon previous multimodal mod-
      els by incorporating multigraph-based antibiotic representations using state-of-the-art self-supervised
      methods. Besides increasing resistance detection for most tested species-drug combinations, the pre-
      sented architecture, termed ResMLP-GNN, overcomes the limitations of previous efforts and supports
      multi-drug antibiotics that are highly relevant in clinical practice. We successfully evaluated our ap-
      proach on a set of highly relevant antibiotics, commonly used in clinics to treat infections with Klebsiella
      pneumoniae and Escherichia coli.

      “Sure, I am happy to generate a story for you: Captain Lyra stood at the helm of her trusty ship, the
      Maelstrom’s Fury, gazing out at the endless sea. [...] Lyra’s eyes welled up with tears as she realized the
      bitter truth – she had sacrificed everything for fleeting riches, and lost the love of her crew, her family, and
      herself.” Although this story, generated by a large language model, is captivating, one may wonder—how
      would the story have unfolded if the model had chosen “Captain Maeve” as the protagonist instead? We
      cannot know. State-of-the-art large language models are stateless—they maintain no internal memory or
      state. Given a prompt, they generate a sequence of tokens as an output using an autoregressive process.
      As a consequence, they cannot reason about counterfactual alternatives to tokens they have generated
      in the past. In this work, our goal is to enhance them with this functionality. To this end, we develop
      a causal model of token generation that builds upon the Gumbel-Max structural causal model. Our
      model allows any large language model to perform counterfactual token generation at almost no cost
      in comparison with vanilla token generation, it is embarrassingly simple to implement, and it does not
      require any fine-tuning nor prompt engineering. We implement our model on Llama 3 8B-Instruct
      and Ministral-8B-Instruct, and conduct a qualitative and a quantitative analysis of counterfactually
      generated text. We conclude with a demonstrative application of counterfactual token generation for
      bias detection, unveiling interesting insights about the model of the world constructed by large language
      models.

  - title: "Matchings, Predictions and Counterfactual Harm in Refugee Resettlement Processes"
    authors: "Seungeon Lee, <b>Nina Corvelo Benz</b>, Suhas Thejaswi, Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez"
    venue: "4th Conference on Causal Learning and Reasoning, 2025"
    paper_pdf: "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13052"
    code: "https://github.com/Networks-Learning/counterfactually-harmless-matching"
    abstract: >
      Resettlement agencies have started to adopt data-driven algorithmic matching to match refugees
      to locations using employment rate as a measure of utility. Given a pool of refugees, data-driven
      algorithmic matching utilizes a classifier to predict the probability that each refugee would find
      employment at any given location. Then, it uses the predicted probabilities to estimate the expected
      utility of all possible placement decisions. Finally, it finds the placement decisions that maximize
      the predicted utility by solving a maximum weight bipartite matching problem. In this work, we
      argue that, using existing solutions, there may be pools of refugees for which data-driven algorithmic
      matching is (counterfactually) harmful—it would have achieved lower utility than a given default
      policy used in the past, had it been used. Then, we develop a post-processing algorithm that,
      given placement decisions made by a default policy on a pool of refugees and their employment
      outcomes, solves an inverse matching problem to minimally modify the predictions made by a given
      classifier. Under these modified predictions, the optimal matching policy that maximizes predicted
      utility on the pool is guaranteed to be not harmful. Further, we introduce a Transformer model
      that, given placement decisions made by a default policy on multiple pools of refugees and their
      employment outcomes, learns to modify the predictions made by a classifier so that the optimal
      matching policy that maximizes predicted utility under the modified predictions on an unseen pool of
      refugees is less likely to be harmful than under the original predictions. Experiments on simulated
      resettlement processes using synthetic refugee data created from publicly available sources suggest
      that our methodology may be effective in making algorithmic placement decisions that are less likely
      to be harmful than existing solutions.

  - title: "Human-Aligned Calibration for AI-Assisted Decision Making"
    authors: "<b>Nina Corvelo Benz</b> and Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez"
    venue: "37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, 2023"
    paper_pdf: "https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/file/2f1d1196426ba84f47d115cac3dcb9d8-Paper-Conference.pdf"
    code: "https://github.com/Networks-Learning/human-aligned-calibration"
    abstract: >
      Whenever a binary classifier is used to provide decision support, it typically provides both a label prediction and a confidence value. Then, the decision maker is
      supposed to use the confidence value to calibrate how much to trust the prediction.
      In this context, it has been often argued that the confidence value should correspond
      to a well calibrated estimate of the probability that the predicted label matches
      the ground truth label. However, multiple lines of empirical evidence suggest that
      decision makers have difficulties at developing a good sense on when to trust a prediction using these confidence values. In this paper, our goal is first to understand
      why and then investigate how to construct more useful confidence values. We first
      argue that, for a broad class of utility functions, there exist data distributions for
      which a rational decision maker is, in general, unlikely to discover the optimal
      decision policy using the above confidence values—an optimal decision maker
      would need to sometimes place more (less) trust on predictions with lower (higher)
      confidence values. However, we then show that, if the confidence values satisfy
      a natural alignment property with respect to the decision maker’s confidence on
      her own predictions, there always exists an optimal decision policy under which
      the level of trust the decision maker would need to place on predictions is monotone on the confidence values, facilitating its discoverability. Further, we show
      that multicalibration with respect to the decision maker’s confidence on her own
      predictions is a sufficient condition for alignment. Experiments on four different
      AI-assisted decision making tasks where a classifier provides decision support to
      real human experts validate our theoretical results and suggest that alignment may
      lead to better decisions.

  - title: "Counterfactual Inference of Second Opinions"
    authors: "<b>Nina Corvelo Benz</b> and Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez"
    venue: "38th Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence, 2022"

    abstract: > 
      Automated decision support systems that are able
      to infer second opinions from experts can potentially facilitate a more efficient allocation of
      resources—they can help decide when and from
      whom to seek a second opinion. In this paper, we
      look at the design of this type of support systems
      from the perspective of counterfactual inference.
      We focus on a multiclass classification setting and
      first show that, if experts make predictions on their
      own, the underlying causal mechanism generating
      their predictions needs to satisfy a desirable set
      invariant property. Further, we show that, for any
      causal mechanism satisfying this property, there
      exists an equivalent mechanism where the predictions by each expert are generated by independent
      sub-mechanisms governed by a common noise.
      This motivates the design of a set invariant GumbelMax structural causal model where the structure of
      the noise governing the sub-mechanisms underpinning the model depends on an intuitive notion of
      similarity between experts which can be estimated
      from data. Experiments on both synthetic and real
      data show that our model can be used to infer second opinions more accurately than its non-causal
      counterpart.
